Define Concepts of SQL and relational databases.

	What is DDL?
Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL statements that change the structure of the database schema in some way, typically by creating, deleting, or modifying schema objects. The most common keywords for DDL are CREATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, DROP, or ALTER.

	What is DML?
Data Manipulation Language. It is used to retrieve, store, modify, delete, insert and update data in database. The most common keywords for DDL are SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, JOIN statements. 

What types of Join Statements are there and the differences?
Join statements are used to combine rows of two or more tables based on related information linking them.

4 types:
Inner Join: Returns all values shared by both tables.
Left Join: Returns all values in left table along with shared values in right table.
Right Join: Returns all values in right table along with the shared values of the left table.
Full Join: Returns all values of both tables if there is at least one shared value between the tables.

	What is the WHERE clause?
Filters records in a SQL statement that follow a specific condition that is specified in the WHERE clause. Can have multiple conditions using AND and OR clauses.

	What is the LIKE clause?
Used in a WHERE clause to find specific patterns in table rows. Uses two symbols.

% - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
_ - The underscore represents a single character

WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that starts with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that ends with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%_%'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"
