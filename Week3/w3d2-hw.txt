Using Retrofit2 and RandomUserAPI, creat an app that displays Name, Adress, and Email. On the bottom have a button to fetch another random user.

Use
ArrayList<Result> usersFetched;
usersFetched.add(result);

Add two buttons, no functionality: ToListView, ToRecyclerView

Research (what are they? what code components are needed? main differences between the two.)

ListView

RecyclerView
