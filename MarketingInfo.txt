Vendor Relationship Manager:
Rohit Nair

Sales Associate:
Capri Smith

Rohit is our connection to the vendors. They have positions, he finds out of them , and he send them our profile. If they are interested, he notifies Capri, who then starts contacting the vendor on my behalf to confirm the interview time, rates, etc...

When interview is confirmed, I receive a Knowledge Transfer (KT) from Capri.

I will receivee marketing skype account, phone number (accessed via app called "Line 2")
Sometimes skype acct can get suspended (SA accesses it overseas, send red flag to skype, they freeze the acct). Prior to interview, just do a quick login to test if the acct is active.
